#### About Zehao
He joined Zhongguancun Academy in 2025. He graduated from Case Western Reserve University in 2023 (in [Shane M. Parker's group](https://quantumparker.com/)), and the postdoc at [Yiqin Gao's group](https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/ktz/wlhx/1402.htm). He is a computational chemist with diverse interests, including fast convergence of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) calculations, efficient solvers for large-scale matrix eigenvalues and linear equations, high-accuracy semi-empirical method TDDFT-ris, optical property simulations of biomacromolecular systems, design near near-infrared absorption molecules and fluorescent probes using generative model, prediction of protein-durg interactions, molecular dynamics simulations of protein-induced cell membrane rupture, and drug-molecule virtual screening, design, and even synthesis. He also contributes to the open-source quantum chemistry packages PySCF and GPU4PySCF.
